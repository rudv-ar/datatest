# puzzle_alpha820

This is a resource for the puzzle which I posted in reddit. Without these datas, the puzzle is unsolvable.
Note, this is not some kind of secret operation guys, instead just a cryptography + steganography + pattern analysis training just meant for entertainment and educational purposes.

> I assure you that there is nothing illegal behind these secrets, no malware or crypto mining stuffs behind it. It is just a usefull link pointing out to a news related to existential crisis and current threats from the bulletin of atomic scientists.

This puzzle : Let me name it as alpha820 is based on a tool which I developed as a part of my sideproject. Resources and the tool is available online. But you need to find it out based on the steps given. I have designed this puzzle in 3 steps.

### Step 1 : Discover the tool. 
This tool is a steganography + encryption where your data becomes indistinguishable from a sequence of dna from the human genome project, chromosome 1.
Further, to add a steganography layer, it will have a .bed format (browser extensible document), similar to any other bioinformation annotation.
How to find out the tool to use?

Decode this binary. It can be raw string pointing to the tool, or a qr code, or even another crypted caeser shifted puzzle.
Here is the binary.

=== FULL BINARY STRING ===
1111111010100111010000111111110000010101001110101101000001101110101000011000111010111011011101001010011011010101110110111010100111010011001011101100000100100011001001010000011111111010101010101010111111100000000011110100001000000000100111111010011111011100101110111100100100010001101011011000100010000010100110100110100110101011101101101010111010010111111101100110100100110000100010100100000000000001111111101110111101001101111110101010110010101000111101100011010110000110111010010011110001000100000000011100100110000101101101101110010111000100001100111110101110001001001001001100111101100000010111001111111100000000011101101001010001100011111110100011010101101011000100000101111110001111000100111011101011011101100111111101110111010100011111010010000001101110100000010110001101101111000001000001001000000110110111111110101100000001101010000

You may have a doubt: How to use the tool? Read it from the readme

### Step 2 : Discover the password.
However, the tool needs a password to decode the secret.md.bed file. Here is the puzzle to get the passphrase.

**Hint :** It is similar to morse code, but different. Same code applies here also. But you need to be little carefull.

=== FULL M-MORSE ===
[#|====|=] [=##=|=#|===|===|=##|###|=#=|#==] [==#=|###|=#=] [#|====|=] [#|###|###|=#==] [==|===] [#|====|=] [==#|===|=|=#=|#=|=#|##|=] [###|==#=] [###|=#=|==|##=|==|#=|=#|=#==] [=##=|###|===|#|=|=#=] [###|==#=] [#|====|==|===] [=##=|###|===|#]


### Step 3 : Discover the real secret
The original secret needs a .bed file to be decoded. You can visit or curl the file preferably from the raw githubusercontent as in the link provided below.

=== THE BED LINK ===
- [rawgithubusercontent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudv-ar/datatest/main/puzzle_alpha820/step3/secret.md.bed)

Just click the link, you will be able to view it or download it. As per the tool, you will need to curl it. Then use the file as per the tool's instructions.
